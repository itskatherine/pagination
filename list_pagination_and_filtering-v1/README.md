This project requires the pagination of a list of fictional students, as well as implementing a search function to narrow down the search.

This project will involve "progressive enhancement", which should mean the original page will function acceptably without javascript enabled, but is enhanced by the inclusion of javascript.

I've attempted the "Exceeds Expectations" grade within this project.

Extra credit features:

- a search bar function
- pagination of search bar results
- a message created when there are zero search results
